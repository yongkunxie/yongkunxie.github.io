1. This study, based on the PV budget, shows the dynamics that shape the climatological circulation over the TP
2. Overshooting in the summer and gravity wave drag in the winter play key roles
3. The diurnal cycle shapes the near-surface cyclonic circulation in summer by regulating the vertical structure of diabatic heating
