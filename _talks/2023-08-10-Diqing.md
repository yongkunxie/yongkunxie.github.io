1. The impact of TP heating on current climate  
    (Previous studies focused on paleoclimate, Asian monsoon, without disentangling mechanical and thermal effects, and no multimodel comparison)  
2. Pacific and Atlantic oceanic repeaters  
    (Heat and moisture transport, atmospheric circulation, and local air-sea interactions)
