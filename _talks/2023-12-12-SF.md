1. The impact of TP heating on modern global climate  
     (Previous studies focused on paleoclimate, Asian monsoon, without disentangling mechanical and thermal effects, and no multimodel comparison)  
2. Pacific and Atlantic oceanic repeaters  
     (Heat and moisture transport, atmospheric circulation, and local air-sea interactions)  
3. The influence of TP warming on Arctic amplification  
     (Atmospheric dynamics, air-sea interactions, and capacitor effect of the Arctic Ocean)
