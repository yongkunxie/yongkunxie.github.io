This dataset is the outputs and codes of CESM experiments performed by the authors for their study titled, "Oceanic repeaters boost the global climatic impact of the Tibetan Plateau", which was submitted to Science Bulletin. There were six CESM experiments, namely amip-hist, amip-TIP-nosh, amip-TIP-alb0.5, amip-TIP-sh0.5, cmip-hist, and cmip-TIP-sh0.5. The CESM model (version 2.1.3) was provided by NCAR/UCAR. In all the experiments, hist (historical) experiments were control runs, whereas the TIP (Tibetan–Iranian Plateau coupling system) -labeled experiments were sensitivity runs.
