**ABSTRACT**  
This presentation will discuss the multi-layered interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice to explore the mechanics of Arctic amplification and its effects on mid-latitudes. The main aspects encompass the factors contributing to Arctic amplification from an energy budget perspective, the two-way connections between the Arctic and mid-latitude regions based on a dynamic and thermodynamic coupling perspective, and the general mechanisms by which the Arctic or oceans influence distant land areas from a potential vorticity perspective.  
**Keywords:** Arctic Amplification, Multi-layered Interactions, Mid-latitudes, Atmospheric Dynamics, Potential Vorticity
